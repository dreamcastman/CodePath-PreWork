## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Favorite applications & favorite features: 

Instagram - Easy to find people you know/have mutual friends with, easy to message people, instagram stories


Tiktok - Amazing recommendation algorithm, focused on videos, for you page really feels like it is tailored to you


Google Maps - Can tell you the estimated amount of time it will take to arrive somewhere, even taking into account traffic, shows a variety of different means of getting somewhere, including buses, walking, biking, taking the train, etc. Can pin places on the map easily

**App idea**: An app that allows a group of users to find the best place to meet in the middle of everyone when they are all at different locations. For example, if there are 3 people in New York City and they want to meet at a Cafe, with person 1 being all the way in the north, person 2 being all the way in the south, and person 3 being in Queens, the app will show cafes near the middle of everyone, likely in the middle of NYC. It can show multiple different cafes which can be sorted by rating or price. This will make it easy for people to meet up somewhere where it is most convenient for the entire group, and the recommendations can be sent into an iMessage group chat showing the ETA for each person.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Some challenges encountered while building the app were mostly related to navigating xCode, due to it being a new software, as well as using the proper Swift syntax, as I have never coded in this language before.
